Go to Profile → Security Settings\n2. Click \"Enable Two-Factor Authentication\"\n3. Scan QR code with Google Authenticator, Authy, or similar app\n4. Enter verification code to confirm\n5. Save backup codes in secure location\n\n## Related\n\n- #101 - SSO authentication (works together with MFA)\n- #104 - Session management\n- External: [OWASP MFA Guidelines](https://owasp.org/mfa)\n\n## Changes\n\nModified by bob@example.com on 2026-01-21 - Added SMS fallback requirement"
